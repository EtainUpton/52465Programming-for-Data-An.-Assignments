# 52465Programming-for-Data-An.-Assignments
This repository will contain my assignments for this course. This module is a 10 credit module.
This is the second semester of this course, and runs for thirteen straight weeks from September 10th to December 13th. 

Ian’s instruction for this assignment;

This assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. The requirement of this assignment is to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. 

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in my Jupyter notebook;
1.	Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2.	Explain the use of “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3.	Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distribution” functions.
4.	Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

Minimum standard:
A git repository containing a README, a gitignore file & a Jupyter notebook. 
The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook.
My notebook should contain the main body of work and list all references.

Good submission requirements;
•	Clearly organised
•	Contain concise explanations of the particularities of the dataset.
•	The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched.
•	Part of the assignment is about the use of Jupyter notebooks – I should make use of all the functionality available in the software including images, links, code & plots.

I knew I needed to bear these conditions in mind while completing this assignment to ensure I met the requirements.
After reading the assignment requirements I knew I would need to look back at my github repositories from last semester in which I submitted assignments for previous modules to refresh my memory on how to use github correctly. 

I had watched most of the videos which were uploaded to Moodle by Ian at this stage which related to Jupyter & NumPy.
