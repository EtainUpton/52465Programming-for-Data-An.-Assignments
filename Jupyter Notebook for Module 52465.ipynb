    "\n",
    "numpy.random is a package for generating random data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned from Ian’s videos on Moodle that the numpy.random package is a sub package of the numpy package in Python. A lot of other packages depend on numpy, but not many interact with it directly, mainly interact with it through other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy.random is mainly to do with generating random numbers. Computers can’t generate random numbers – they can only generate pseudorandom numbers (for the time being!). There are a lot of different ways to generate different pseudorandom numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ian was observing the following webpage in the video; https://docs.scipy.org\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "*NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.*\n",
    "(Reference: https://docs.scipy.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned that NumPy is exceptionally quick at dealing with numbers in long lists in Python – even lists contained within lists!\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a specialist package which deals with multidimensional arrays – it liked 2D/rectangular lists. It knows how to complete operations on the lists/arrays quickly. It has algorithms built into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we don’t create arrays in numpy, we use different packages such as numpy.random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ian informed us in his video ‘Introduction to numpy’ that an example of one of the uses of numpy is a task which I complete regularly - resizing a photo, making it smaller, on my PC. The matrix operations behind this are usually linked with numpy, as it knows how to complete these operations quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up numpy.random repository video;\n",
    "Note: Ian advised that we should shut down Jupyter before making any amendments in Git to prevent avoidable issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned from my research online that;\n",
    "*An important part of any simulation is the ability to generate random numbers. For this purpose, NumPy provides various routines in the submodule random. It uses a particular algorithm, called the Mersenne Twister, to generate pseudorandom numbers.\n",
    "First, we need to define a seed that makes the random numbers predictable. When the value is reset, the same numbers will appear every time. If we do not assign the seed, NumPy automatically selects a random seed value based on the system's random number generator device or on the clock*:\n",
